You are a junior software developer at a financial company. Your task is to develop a program that
calculates an employee's income based on the number of hours worked and hourly rate. The
program should also calculate deductions for income tax and superannuation. You will need to
create a pseudocode and flow chart to show your design process and develop a working program
using Python 3 language.
The case study involves a fictional country where individuals are taxed based on their income. The
income is determined by multiplying the number of hours worked by the hourly rate. Each individual
is taxed at 20%. Students must develop a program that can take in user input for hours worked and
hourly rate, to calculate the income and then apply the appropriate taxes owed based on the fixed
tax rate of 20%. The program must also consider any superannuation deductions, which is 10% of
the income.
For example, if an employee user, “John Smith”, enters 40 hours worked and hourly rate of $25 per
hour, as shown in Table 1. Then, the total income will be $1000, of which 20% is taxed ($200) and
10% deducted for superannuation ($100)
